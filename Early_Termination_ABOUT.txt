Early_Termination

This is a facility I cooked up, because VBA is sort of single-threaded
and won't let Excel recognise button clicks while VBA is executing.
Hence you can't click a button to cancel or halt execution of a VBA macro.
So this facility lets you click a button to exit out of a loop
you may get stuck in.  Here's how it works.

Within the loop you may get stuck in (ex: "For" loop), add the line:

      If (Request_For_Early_Termination()) Then Exit For

And include the Early_Termination module in your VBA code in your workbook.
The Request_For_Early_Termination() checks for existance of an 
"c:\aaa\terminate.*" file on your disk.  So if it doesn't find it, your
VBA program continues looping.  But if it does find such a file, it 
takes it as a sign to exit out of its loop.

At the same time as you run your VBA code in one Excel workbook, also start a separate 
instance of Excel in a separate window, and run the Early_Termination.XLS  workbook there.
Early_Termination.XLS presents a button, and when you click it, it creates the "c:\aaa\terminate.txt"
file on disk, signalling your other VBA program to break out of its loop.

For an example of an application using Request_For_Early_Termination() function,
see TS3_CAN_Test.xls.
