TS3_DSP_Timestamp.VBS

Does an automatic edit on source file recording timestamp and version info, that is subsequently compiled into the DSP code.

Reads the "TimeStamp.c" file, in the same folder as the "TS3_DSP_Timestamp.vbs" file.  Edits the following section supplying current system date and time, and incrementing the "C" octet of the version.



// Automatic edit changes this version and timestamp, in compatible format to FPGA timestamps
// we have a CAN command to read timestamp and version information
const Uint16 timeStamp_t1 = 0x1510; // BCD YYMM (0x1504 => 2015 April)
const Uint16 timeStamp_t2 = 0x1414; // BCD DDHr (0x2315 => 23rd day of month, 3 pm)
const Uint16 timeStamp_t3 = 0x36A5; // BCD MnA5 (0x25A5 => 25 min past the hour, A5 is a constant)
const Uint16 revision_rv1 = 0x0101; // 2 binary bytes A.B
const Uint16 revision_rv2 = 0x3800; // 2 binary bytes C.0 (version is A.B.C, 0 indicates DSP)
