Wav_File_Splitter_v3.vbs

This program read a WAV format audio file and splits it into multiple files. There are two principal options: either

1. split into multiple, equal length files, or

2. split into 2 files at a given point in time in the file.

For example I use the 1st option if I have a 60-minute audio file of a person speaking, and I want to split it into a bunch of 5-minute tracks, for quicker access as I'm listening through the file.

I use the 2nd option as a crude way to excerpt "sound bytes" out of a longer speech.

TO OPERATE

Run the macro, I usually double-click on the VBS file in Windows Explorer.  

It asks you to specify first the path to the folder containing the WAV file, and then the file name of the .WAV file.

It asks for an "OK before parsing it.

Then it reads the file header and displays some header info -- this was useful when I was debugging the program, but not necessary for it's core function of file splitting.

Then it gives you the option to
1 Split the file into equal length segments, or
2 Split the file at a point in time

Continuing, it asks the relevant questions, and produces output files by appenfing numerals onto the original file name.  For example "Fishing_Epic_by_Kevin_Kling.wav" is parsed to produce 2 output files, "Fishing_Epic_by_Kevin_Kling_01.wav", and "Fishing_Epic_by_Kevin_Kling_02.wav".
